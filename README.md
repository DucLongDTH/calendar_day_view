# Calendar Day View

This package is dedicated to calendar day view. While there are many calendar package out there.
It seems that not many of them support Day view well. This library clearly is not a replace calendar but rather to be used with calendar in the app that need better day views

## Features

- In row day view: show all events that start in the same time gap in a row
- Event day view: show all events in day
- Over flow day view: like normal calendar where event is displayed expanded on multiple time row to indicate its duration

## Installing the library:

Like any other package, add the library to your pubspec.yaml dependencies:

```
dependencies:
    calendar_day_view: <latest_version>
```

Then import it wherever you want to use it:

```
import 'package:fetching_state/calendar_day_view.dart';
```

## Usage

look at example folder
